# [Polygonograph](https://dkallen78.github.io/polygonograph/polygonograph.html)

For the past week or so I've had it in my head to draw some polygons programmatically. It started with drawing shapes with my kid and I realized I really suck at drawing pentagons and heptagons. I also drew lines between vertices and edges and enjoyed the patterns so I decided to put my computer to the task of doing it accurately.

The Polygonograph draws polygons of up to 50 sides. It can also draw lines between vertices and between vertices and the midpoints of the edges. It's also capable of drawing star polygrams but it can't yet handle degenerate cases similar to the Star of David.
